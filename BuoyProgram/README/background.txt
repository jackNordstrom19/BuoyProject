Problem:
Researchers in Melbourne, Florida, where 25% of the world's sea turtle
population lives, lack key information necessary to understand on and
offshore habitats. The sea turtle population is essential to conservation
efforts.

Opportunity:
Through partnerships with Brevard Zoo, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University,
James Madison University, and other universities, volunteers, faculty, and 
students will prototype sensing and data collection technology that will
fill key gaps in available data.

Goal:
Provide researchers with sensor and data collection technology that affords
them full insight into the sea turtle life cycle without disturbing their
habitats. This will be vital to understanding population risks and influencing
conservation policy.

Program:
This program's purpose is to communicate commands and data between a buoy and 
drone. A buoy is able to measure its latitude and longitude, the temperature of
the surrounding water, and the radio frequency identification number of the tag
of a passing turtle. Using a mySQL database, the buoy is able to store, transmit,
and receive any of this data according to how it is commanded by an external client.
